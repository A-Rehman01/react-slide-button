| minSlideWidth    | `float`                  | 0.6     | Minimum width that a user needs to slide till to change the button state to slide state. Value ranges from `0-1`. For example, `0.6` means user needs to slide atleast till 60% of total width of button to set it to slide state. |
| minSlideVelocity | `float`                  | 0.6     | Other way to change button state to slide is to slide it quickly. If the slide velocity is above this value then button is set to slide state.                                                                                     |

**Note**: Even if user slides to lesser distance than the one specified by `minSlideWidth` option, if his slide velocity is above `minSlideVelocity` the button state will be changed to slide.

### Development

Firstly move on the Package Folder.

```bash
cd package
```

then install the dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install`.

Now , use the following command to create a link locally, which is to be used in example project, using the following command

```bash
npm link
```

Now start the automatic rebuild for hot reloading purpose using the command:

```bash
npm start
```

Keep this terminal opened and move onto next step.

Now you need to start the example project, to do this make sure your current directory is `/example`, install its dependencies too using `npm install` or `yarn install` command. Now link react-slide-button to the example project using the command:

```bash
npm link react-slide-button
```

Now you can start the example project by running the command:

```
npm start
```

Now you are ready to make changes to `/src/index.js` file.
